TRON GAME DOCUMENTATION APPENDIX
Whats new in version 2?

- Big update on how the game handles player animations and elapsed time in general. The animations are now super smooth and on a pixelbasis.

- Changed how a the player bike handles inputs and turn signals from release events to on-pressed events. The choices made in the GUI are now remembered by the players character for the next time he would make a turn.

- Fixed some mayor annoyances with the code and its structure. The codebase now relies on fewer magic numbers and more clearly handles various game events.
- Further bug fixes.
